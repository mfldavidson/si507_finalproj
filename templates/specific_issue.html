  <h3>Petitions You Can Sign Now</h3>
  <p>Petitions you can sign now are either open petitions that have not yet passed their deadline (petitions where the status is "open"), or petitions that have surpassed the 100,000 signatures required to get a response from the White House but have not yet received a response (petitions where the status is "pending response").</p>
  {% if not open_petitions %}
  There are no signable {{ issue.name }} petitions.
  {% else %}
  {{ open_petitions_table }}
  {% endif %}

  <h3>Closed Petitions</h3>
  <p>Closed petitions are either petitions that have passed their deadline without receiving the 100,000 signatures required to get a response from the White House (petitions where the status is "closed"), or petitions that did receive 100,000 signatures and the White House has already responded (petitions where the status is "responded"). You can view the White House's response on the original petition page by clicking "View Petition."</p>
  {% if not closed_petitions %}
  There are no closed {{ issue.name }} petitions.
